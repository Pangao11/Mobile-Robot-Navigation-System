# Mobile-Robot-Navigation-System

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on mobile robot navigation. The system integrates various algorithms and models to achieve accurate trajectory planning, odometry modeling, line extraction, ICP (Iterative Closest Point), and Kalman filtering. The project is structured to provide modular and scalable components for easy adaptation and extension.

## Features

- **Trajectory Planning**: Implements efficient algorithms to plan optimal paths for the mobile robot.
- **Odometry Model**: Provides robust odometry calculations to track the robot's movement.
- **Line Extraction**: Utilizes advanced techniques to extract lines from sensor data for environment mapping.
- **ICP (Iterative Closest Point)**: Aligns point clouds for precise localization and mapping.
- **Kalman Filtering**: Integrates sensor data and odometry for improved state estimation and noise reduction.
